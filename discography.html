                    <p>The Monkees is the first album by the band The Monkees. It was released in October 1966 by Colgems Records in the United States 
                    and RCA Victor in the rest of the world. It was the first of four consecutive U.S. number one albums for the group, taking the top 
                    spot on the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks, after which it was displaced by the band's second album. It also topped the UK charts in 1967.
                    The Monkees has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA, with sales of over five million copies.</p>

                    <p>More of the Monkees is the second full-length album by the Monkees. It was recorded in late 1966 and released on Colgems label #102
                    on January 9, 1967. It displaced the band's debut album from the top of the Billboard 200 chart and remained at No.1 for 18 weeksâ€”the 
                    longest of any Monkees album. Combined, the first two Monkees albums were at the top of the Billboard chart for 31 consecutive weeks. 
                    More of the Monkees also went to No.1 in the UK. In the U.S. it has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA with sales of more 
                    than five million copies. More of the Monkees is also notable for being the first pop/rock album to be the best-selling album of the year
                    in the U.S.</p>

                    <p>Headquarters is the third album issued by the Monkees and the first with substantial songwriting and instrumental performances by 
                    members of the group itself, rather than by session musicians and professional songwriters. After a struggle for creative autonomy with
                    their record label, the group had been allowed to record by themselves. Headquarters reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was 
                    certified double platinum in the United States with sales of more than two million copies within the first two months of release. It 
                    peaked at #2 on the UK charts. It is included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.</p>

                    <p>Head is the soundtrack to the film Head, the only theatrical release by The Monkees. Released in 1968 through Colgems, it was the band's 
                    sixth album. Head was the last Monkees album to feature Peter Tork until Pool It! in 1987 and the last to feature all four Monkees until 1996's Justus.</p>

                    <p>The soundtrack album intersperses the six full-length songs ("Porpoise Song", "Circle Sky", "Can You Dig It?", "As We Go Along", "Daddy's Song" and "Long Title: 
                    Do I Have to Do This All Over Again?") with bits of Ken Thorne's incidental music, dialogue fragments, and sound effects culled from the film. The selection of music 
                    and dialogue approximates the flow of the movie itself, and was compiled by actor Jack Nicholson, who co-wrote the film's shooting script.</p>
